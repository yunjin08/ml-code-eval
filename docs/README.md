# Thesis Methodology – Documentation

This folder documents how we executed the four-phase methodology: data gathering and exploration, model training, governance experiment, and final evaluation. Update these docs when you run full training or change the pipeline.

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| [01_data_gathering_and_exploration.md](01_data_gathering_and_exploration.md) | Data source, curation steps, exploration (balance, missing data), artifacts |
| [02_model_training.md](02_model_training.md) | CodeBERT and Random Forest training, validation benchmarking, selected model |
| [03_evaluation.md](03_evaluation.md) | Governance experiment outputs, metrics, statistical tests, hypothesis validation |

Run order: **Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4** (see main [../README.md](../README.md)).
